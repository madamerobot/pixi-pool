                  'Sponge mode', what is that supposed to mean? Since catching the coding bug, I am soaking in every little bit of knowledge I can get my hands on. How I ended up as a sponge? Well, let me tell you..

                  In late 2016, while being a Digital Marketing Manager for adidas in Amsterdam, I found myself gravitating more and more towards technology. Mainly working on (amazing) campaign concepts, 
                  I missed a closer connection to websites and apps. At the same time, I started a weekly Creative Coding course at Makerversity where I learnt how to create art with JavaScript library p5.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While discovering this beautiful intersection between aesthetics and logic, I got hooked and skipped my usual metro stop. I decided to take on a different path and follow a new born passion, 
                  so I left adidas and signed up for a full-time Web Development Course at New York Code and Design Academy in Amsterdam. In Autumn 2017 I took on my first role as Web Developer Intern at Design 
                  & Technology agency Your Majesty where I now work as Junior Web Developer.

                  I have been working on both front- and back-end development, while generally trying to move into a more object oriented, modular programming style. I'm also learning more about software architectural 
                  patterns like the Model-view-controller, and how to best set up your data-flow. My current focus of interest sits around data handling and building data pipelines.
