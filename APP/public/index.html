                <p>If you like Pizza, you will never starve in Amsterdam. Almost every day a week there is a Tech-Meetup that gives away free and greasy deliciousness alongside Nerd-talks. I didn't want to do the same.</p>
                <p>I wanted to create a Tech-Meetup that is inclusive for any sort of experience level and where people can ask all the 'dumb' questions they are normally afraid of. I decided to create the 'first non-awkward Tech-Meetup',
                and Cafe Robot was born.
                </p>
                <p>Cafe Robot is a community for newbie-developers and code-hobbyists in Amsterdam. We usually meet once a month to discuss ideas and questions and to have 1-3 drinks. If you want to stay in touch, sign up for our newsletter

                <p>What I love most about the web-development community is a general openness to share knowledge and to stand 'on the shoulder of giants'. I enjoy a lot to contribute to this and therefore
                like giving talks, workshops or classes.</p>

                <h1><span class="marker blue">Human Centered Development</span></h1>
                <p>While teaching at Digital School Hyper Island I developed the concept of 'Human Centered Development' which I firmly believe in and follow in my day-to-day work.</p>
                <p>'Human Centered Development' takes inspiration from IDEOs 'Human Centered Design' approach and maps it towards the tech-industry. At the core of this concepts sits
                the following paradigm: "Technology is a tool to build a solution to a problem. Technology is not the the solution."</p>
                <p>As I see the user at the center of any technical implementation, I find it very important to step back from 'RDD (Resume Driven Development)' but rather invest time
                into understanding the users or clients needs.</p>
                <p>This can be achieved in several ways. When working on technical problems, I personally use a lot of communication to clarify on use-cases, eliminate assumptions and find
                the most economical and time-efficient solution.</p>
                <p>Wikipedia defines 'Web Technology' as 'Communication between computers'. In my opinion it should rather be 'Communication between humans on computers'.</p>
